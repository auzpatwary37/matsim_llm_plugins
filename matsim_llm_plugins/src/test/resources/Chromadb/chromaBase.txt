What is MATSim?
MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) is an open-source, activity-based, agent-based transport simulation framework. It is designed to model large-scale transportation scenarios by simulating the daily travel behavior of individual agents (representing people) over a synthetic or real population.

Each agent in MATSim has a daily activity plan — including home, work, shopping, and other activities — and chooses routes and modes of transport based on personal preferences and network conditions. MATSim then simulates the execution of these plans on a detailed transport network and evaluates performance based on travel times, delays, and other metrics.

Key Features
Activity-Based Modeling: Agents follow complete daily schedules rather than single trips.
Agent-Based Simulation: Individual decision-making allows for rich behavioral dynamics.
Iterative Learning: Agents revise plans over multiple iterations to optimize utility.
Scalability: Efficiently simulates millions of agents and large networks.
Modular Architecture: Supports plugins for demand modeling, transit, freight, emissions, and now even LLM-based decision-making.
Applications
Urban mobility and infrastructure planning
Evaluation of transport policies (e.g., congestion pricing, new transit lines)
EV charging behavior and infrastructure placement
Disaster evacuation and emergency scenarios
Integration with AI and machine learning for dynamic decision support
