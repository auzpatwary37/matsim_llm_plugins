This project is designed to connect large language models to MATSim. The code contacts the LLM models through API calls. 
Currently also support function calling. 
Create a package called apikey and put your own API key for GPT. 
Examples are there for chat completion. 

Sister project is EV_Montreal, the Ai_Agent branch.
